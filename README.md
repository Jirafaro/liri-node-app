# liri-node-app

This client side application is used for searching through API's to sort the information and displays basic information based off of the search term. 

The App is organized through a switch case with functions and Axios calls to retrieve the information desired and display the basic return information to the user. 

The App is used by typing in node liri.js (see next line)<br>
And then one of the following --> concert-this / spotify-this-song / movie-this / do-what-it-says <br>
This will retrieve information from the different API based off of the search term and display it in the basic format laid out.

The App uses Axios / API / Javascript / JSON / .gitignore / .env 

I developed this app.
